# Barcodes

Barcodes is a simple app for scanning barcodes, looking them up on [UPC Database](http://upcdatabase.org), and searching for the result on [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

## Setting Up

To use the app, you need to get an API key from UPC Database. Once you've registered an account there, your API key can be found in the [API control panel](http://upcdatabase.org/ucp-api).

## Acknowledgments

Barcodes uses [TSMessages](https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages) for notifying the user that a barcode has been detected.
